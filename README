__Usage__
Audio in at CONN1, audio transformer between CONN1 and CONN2, on/off switching at CONN3. Useful for Push-To-Talk systems.

__Design__
Placing a 1nF capacitor at input to D1 prevents stray rectification. Use of appropriately valued non-polarized capacitors maximizes VHF/UHF suppression.

Ideally T1 should be a step up transformer.
